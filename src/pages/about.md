## Hello, world ðŸ‘‹

Sooo, I am Stavros, a 14 year old reckless engineer based in Greece. I am interested in Web Development with my favorite frameworks being React, Vite, Tailwind CSS and Next. I would also consider myself a Go developer, I like using Go for backend operations due to how fast it is and also I love the ecosystem around it and the developer experience. Last but not least I know some Python and maybe C++? Apart from programming I really like self-hosting different applications for fun and also I am a Raspberry Pi fanboy. I also really like basketball! _yes I touch grass_
