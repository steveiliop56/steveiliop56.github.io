I am working/have worked on some cool projects. Here are my favorite ones:

- [Runtipi](https://github.com/runtipi/runtipi) - Runtipi is a homeserver for everyone! One command setup, one click installs for your favorites self-hosted apps.
- [GetAShell](https://github.com/steveiliop56/getashell) - An easy way to create SSH boxes to test things quickly on a Linux environment from a web UI.
- [PyOS](https://github.com/steveiliop56/PyOS) - A Linux-like "operating system" written in Python and of course... it is better than windows!
- [PyDucky](https://github.com/steveiliop56/pyducky) - A simple Python scripts that gets you up and running with pico-ducky fast and easy.
